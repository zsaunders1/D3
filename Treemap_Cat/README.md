The visual here is a Treemap made using D3 and javascript. The Treemap was an attempt at seeing if there was some correlation
between the breed of a cat, whether it was a kitten or a fully-grown cat, and the outcome of its adoption (adopted, returned,
euthanized, etc.). Since this is a preliminary chart, only 280 data points were used (refer to .csv file). Additionally, the
coloring for the Treemap is not correct at the moment, and needs to be worked on. That being said, data is being read and
represented correctly, as the ratio of the area of a block to the total area of the treemap was more or less equivalent to the
ratio of the size of the data the block represented to the total amount of data, for every block in the Treemap.
